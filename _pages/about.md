  Hello I am Vishnu. I recently graduated from Stony Brook University(SBU) with a master's degree in Applied Mathematics and Statistics. 
  
  The main focus of my research is derivative pricing (mostly on options) and volatility forecasting. I am guided by Prof. Aaron Kim. I am trying to bridge traditional finance models with machine learning techniques that make predicitons which can guide investing strategies. We live in a time where a lot of information is easily accesible and we are at a point where this can be leveraged to make informed decisions. 
  
  
  In my github account you can find my work and the progress I'm making. It also exists so that my work, one day, could be useful to somebody. In case you would like to exchange some ideas please feel free to connect with me on Linkedin or just shoot me a mail. You can access my CV and portfolio in the sidebar.  Thank you for reading.
