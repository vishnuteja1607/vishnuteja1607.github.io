  Recentyly graduated with my master's in Applied Mathematics and Statistics (M.S) from Stony Brook Univeristy. When I began my master's program, I just wanted to soak in as much as I can and was not sure what exactly I wanted to do in career. I had the absolute privilege to collaborate with highly regarded professors and talented peers working on various projects. My experience with Professor Kim, who teaches finance, was defintely one of the highlight's of my time at SBU. Quantitative Finance is where my interest lies and this is what I want to work on for the rest of my career.

  I am very curious about derivative pricing, especially options. Risk management is also something that piqued my interest. Currently I am working on vaiours projects in these topics. You can find them on Github linked on the left.

  On the flip side, I enjoy watching movies. It's the perfect way for me to unwind. I am also a huge fan of Formuala 1. Supporitng Scuderia Ferrari reminds me of this quote from the tv series Malcolm in the Middle - "I expect nothing and am still disappointed". More recently I have been interested in the philosophy of Stoicism and try to learn something new about it whenever I can.
