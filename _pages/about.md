  Studying Applied Mathematics and Statistics (M.S) at Stony Brook Univeristy. Interested in finance and data analytics. Currently I am collaborating with Prof. Aaron Kim (School of Business) on derivative pricing where the focus is on coming up with a model to price stock options. When I began my master's program, I just wanted to soak in as much as I can and was not sure what exactly I wanted to do. Working with Prof. Kim made me see that I like finanical modeling and this is where I want to make a career in. I am also assiting Professors Sana Malik and Melissa Bessaha (School of Public Health and Welfare) with their research on understanding the healthcare seeking behaviours of grad student during the COVID-19 pandemic; I help out by analyzing the survey results gathered under this research project. In the past I worked as a Teaching Assitant for the course Operations Management taught by Professor Katsunobu Sasunama. That gave me a good insight into Operations Research, which happens to be my concentration, from a business/management perspective apart from the mathematical rigor.
  
  On the flip side, I enjoy watching movies. It's the perfect way for me to unwind. I am also a huge fan of Formuala 1. Supporitng Scuderia Ferrari reminds me of this quote from the tv series Malcolm in the Middle - "I expect nothing and am still disappointed". More recently I have been interested in the philosophy of Stoicism and try to learn something new about it whenever I can.
